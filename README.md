# ENGR-112 Project
This repository includes my team's MATLAB Code for our semester-long project. This repository was used to collaborate between team members during development and is only meant to SHOWCASE our work to the public thereafter. Any other use (such as copying) is not condoned by these creators and is considered an honor code violation at most institutions of higher education. As such, please do not contact us regarding this specific project. Recall that 'An Aggie does not lie cheat or steal or tolerate those who do so'.
